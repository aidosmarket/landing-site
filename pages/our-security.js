                                    By default, new accounts are set up to use email verification for all sensitive
                                    operations, such as withdrawals and settings changes. Even so, we recommend
                                    configuring your cellphone to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) for your
                                    account.

                                    Two-factor authentication (2FA) can be set up by visiting the security page on your
                                    account and following the instructions shown. It will provide an extra layer of
                                    security for your account.

                                    If you have lost your phone and need to reset two-factor authentication, the process
                                    is different depending on the authentication method you chose for your account:

                                    For Authy, you need to visit their own reset page. When you fill out the required
                                    information, you will receive reset instructions at the email you registered when
                                    you installed the app on your cellphone.
                                    For Google Authenticator, you will need to use the secret code that you wrote down
                                    when you set up two-factor authentication. Enter the app and manually add an account
                                    using that secret code.
                                    If you use SMS, the reset is handled using Authy as well. You can reset your SMS
                                    verification on their reset page.
